# Blind-Stick-using-Arduino-Uno-Ultrasonic-Sensor
As part of my journey in exploring electronics and embedded systems, I created a blind stick prototype using an Arduino Uno, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and a buzzer. This project aims to assist visually impaired individuals by detecting obstacles within a set range and emitting an audible alert through a buzzer, offering a simple yet effective

How It Works:

The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to any obstacles in front of the stick.
When an object is detected within the defined range, a buzzer is triggered, alerting the user of a nearby obstacle.
The device is customizable, allowing for adjustments in the detection range for different environments.

 Key Components:

Arduino Uno for processing
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor for distance measurement
Buzzer for audible alerts

 Skills Used:
Programming in C++ for Arduino, working with sensors, and understanding distance measurement principles.

This project demonstrates the potential of small-scale electronics to create meaningful, assistive technology. Looking forward to learning more and building even more impactful projects in the future!
