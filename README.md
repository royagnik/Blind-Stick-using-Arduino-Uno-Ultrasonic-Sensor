# Blind-Stick-using-Arduino-Uno-Ultrasonic-Sensor
As part of my journey in exploring electronics and embedded systems, I created a blind stick prototype using an Arduino Uno, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and a buzzer. This project aims to assist visually impaired individuals by detecting obstacles within a set range and emitting an audible alert through a buzzer, offering a simple yet effective

How It Works:

The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to any obstacles in front of the stick.
When an object is detected within the defined range, a buzzer is triggered, alerting the user of a nearby obstacle.
The device is customizable, allowing for adjustments in the detection range for different environments.
